## How to play the game

Once you have the game running in your browser. Use the "Up", "Down, "Left", "Right" arrow keys to navigate the player past the enemies to reach the other side without colliding with any of the enemies. When the player collides with an enemy or reaches the other side, the game will reset the player's position to the bottom of the grid.
