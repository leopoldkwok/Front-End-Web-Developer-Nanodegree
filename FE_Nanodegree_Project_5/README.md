Neighborhood Map of London
==========================

This project creates a map of the City of London. It shows a google map with markers for a number of London's attractions, a list view of these places and a search bar for filtering places and when the place is clicked on displays a list of Wikipedia articles.

It implements [Knockout](http://www.knockoutjs.com) and the *Google Maps* and *Wikipedia* API's
