/*

For this quiz, can you use this script, which is in the <head> of index.html,
to change the boring placeholder image to a picture of a cute puppy?

Remember, you'll need to pass a function into the jQuery object to run
when the document is ready.

Here's a URL for a picture of a puppy: http://placepuppy.it/350/150

Good luck!

$(function() {
  $('img').attr('src', 'http://placekitten.com/350/150');
})
