Project Requirements for Cat Clicker Premium

Visuals

The application should display

a list of cats by name
an area to display the selected cat
In the cat display area, the following should be displayed

the cat's name
a picture of the cat
text showing the number of clicks
The specifics of the layout do not matter, so style it however you'd like.
Interaction

When a cat name is clicked in the list, the cat display area should update to show the data for the selected cat.
The number of clicks in the cat area should be unique to each cat, and should increment when the cat's picture is clicked.
Resources

Check out the earlier reading node on how to deal with event listeners and closures. You likely will need it to get the click events for your cat list to work.
